brekkie
======

A small, quick webapp that will step you through making breakfast for your date.

## Running brekkie
brekkie is a static webapp. All you should need to do is point your web server at the root directory of this repo. For example, I'm quite fond of [Nodejitsu's http server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server):
```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
